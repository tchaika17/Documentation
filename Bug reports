# 1) Bug reports for a desktop application

About the application: 
It is an application to convert and optimize pictures for presentation on a community website. The user can preview pictures in the application, select, delete, 
rotate and optimize it (change brightness, sharpness, contrast). All pictures converse and compresse in big versions, thumbnails. The user can also add a logo (watermark)
to a big-version picture and select a cover for a gallery. The created gallery will then be compressed in a zip-file for uploading to the community's web server.
